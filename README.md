# ArrayPractice
With a 1D array of integers, I write three methods to 
display the columnSum and average of the array, display the number of odd and even
numbers, and display the largest two numbers. With two 1D arrays, I display
the common elements betweeen two arrays. With a 2D array, the columnSum of the 
maximum value of each row and column.
